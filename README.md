# React Pizza Market

Made according to the course [Pizza React (Archakov)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0FGkDGJQjJFMRmP7wZ771m1Nx-m2_qXq)

## I learned a lot of new things!!!
* The work and interaction of React x Redux has become more understandable.
* Before that, I only knew about connect, but now I know about __useDispatch__ and __useSelector__, which is much more convenient and is used in a functional component.
* I learned what __middleware__ is and how to use it.
* And there was also the use of fake server data, which also bore fruit in the development.
